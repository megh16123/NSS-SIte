                        to the current problems. Through this essential subunit of NSS, we strive to make people aware about the fact that without protecting and taking care of our environment we’re putting too many lives in danger and we cannot take
                        it for granted. To promote this idea the most recent Avani event, "Nature Walk" was organized, with the objective of helping people understand the various plant and animal species found in the area and also the measures that are
                        currently being taken to extend the life of the wildlife as much as possible.

                        this community and identify their needs as well as problems. An event conducted under Project Indriya was named "Hear Signs". This was a reel making competition on the topic 'We sign for human rights', where participants were to
                        deliver a powerful message using only sign language, no words. This really helped us establish the importance of the masses learning and using sign language so as to be inclusive towards the community which uses non verbal means
                        of communication on a day-to-day basis.
