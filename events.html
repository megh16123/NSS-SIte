                        Panchal. Sir has been a trainer to International actors like Emma Watson and Indian actors like Kangana Ranaut, Shahid Kapoor, etc. The session was divided into two phases. The first session took place on the lawn outside the auditorium.
                        In that session, Sir made all the students do warm up exercises which consisted of light stretching, pranayam, bhangra and a few steps of aerobics too. In the second phase, which was conducted in the auditorium, Sir shared his
                        journey of becoming a fitness coach and International Yoga Instructor. The event was a great success in making students understand that workout can be a fun activity and it also very well taught the students the importance of being
                        fit.

                        rather to make women themselves recognize their strength. The event was interactive and lighthearted but also conveyed its message strongly. The ecent started off with an enthralling speech by the project heads and core members
                        of Project Veerangana, and then moved on to a series of fun activities. The volunteers truly did a spedid job engaging the audience and recieved a lot of appreciation for this event.

                    <p class="timeline__content-desc">This event was planned keeping in mind the festivities and the essence of Christmas and was executed to make this Christmas one of the best our elders would have celebrated. Since Santa is believed to bring gifts for children on Christmas
                        eve, so the volunteers of Project Vriddhi thought we should do the same for our elders who themselves deserve to be loved and pampered as children when they grow older. This event was divided into 2 parts. Day one was all about
                        collecting the gifts and goodies to be donated to the elderly and making them cards to be gifted to make them feel special. About 90 volunteers came to college to donate and make cards for the elderly, the number of gifts collected
                        was greater than 200. The next day was all about visiting the old age home and distributing gifts and spreading happiness among the elders. Team Vriddhi decided to visit the “Silver Lining Old Age Home” in Dwarka. Before distributing
                        gifts and cards, the volunteers interacted with the elderly, played games with them, sang their favourite songs, danced with them, and listened to their games. After the completion of the event, the smiling faces of the elderly
                        and the happiness which we could sense radiating from them was worth all our efforts.

                        close lens, so as to give us clarity as to what we can expect, if we opt to be a part of it. The college auditorium was filled with 100% capacity, over 500 students, and there were many students who were waiting outside to be a
                        part of the event. The event was very interactive as we were given the opportunity to ask any doubt that we had in our minds regarding NCC and its functioning.
